# DooT

A sample project demonstrating how to build an AI-powered application using [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) and [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction).

## Getting Started
You will need to update the `appsettings.json` file with your own [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) from OpenAI.
